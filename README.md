# Bike Sharing Project

## Overview of Project

 Produce a story using data visualizations created using Tableau using public data on a bike-sharing program in New York. The overall goal is to conduct bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, we will also use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from the CSV Dataset from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we will create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, we will add these new visualizations to the two we created in this module for our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format (Pandas)
- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis (Tableau)
- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation (README File)
